#WCF Integration

These examples will demonstrate our WCF integration.

Tip of the day:

Make sure that the cursor is inside your service class when you start the application. By doing so the WCF test client will automatically be started.

Also remember to continue debugging if the exception assistant is enabled (if you want OneTrueError to catch the exception).
